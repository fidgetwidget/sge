# Small Galaxy Engine (haxe)

My Hobbiest Gamedev code.


## Install Instructions

This is a haxe & openfl project so you'll need those:

http://www.openfl.org/documentation/getting-started/installing-openfl/

I am doing all(most) of my playing with it on a mac, so I haven't tested it in all targets


### Samples

- blockDrop : A tetris clone
- brickBreaker (broken) : An allyway clone
- sanke : Snake...
 
### Games (bigger examples)

- tileworld : wip terraria-style world building platformer
